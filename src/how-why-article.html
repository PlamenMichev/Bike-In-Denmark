                        The <strong>time saving</strong> part is the first great benefit from biking. Basically,
                        moving
                        to every place in
                        the city is faster with a bike. Driving a car can take you in endless junctions. Catching
                        the
                        bus means waiting on stops and sometimes switching multiple buses for a simple route. With a
                        bike you move quickly, and in Denmark you <strong>have more privileges</strong> than other
                        vehicles. You hurry
                        past the traffic lights and sometimes even skip them (when you are turning right). You can
                        also
                        <strong>take shortcuts</strong> to move faster. Last but not least, you park your bike in a
                        flash as there are
                        parking spots at most of the places.

                        The second part is the <strong>money saving</strong> part. Yes, in Denmark, buying a new
                        bike is
                        more expensive
                        than in most of the European countries but that doesn't mean that having a bike is expensive
                        and
                        requires a high first payment. You can easily find a descend <strong>second-hand
                            bike</strong>,
                        buy some lights,
                        a lock and a helmet and you journey can begin. You don't have to pay for fuel, bus tickets,
                        parking or taxes in SKAT. It is just you and your bike, so you are flexible with your time,
                        and
                        you can easily move around your city.

                        The third and yet maybe one of the best things is that <strong>it is healthy</strong>. The
                        physical effort that
                        you put during cycling is enough for a young person be to be fit. If you just want to look
                        good
                        and not have a lot of muscle mass, biking to your school and back is more than enough to
                        achieve
                        it. What is more, you are going to <strong>feel better</strong>. Although it is exhausting,
                        you
                        will have more
                        energy, the quality of your sleep will improve, you will be more durable, and you will not
                        have
                        to worry that much about your carbs intake.

                <h4 class="sub-article-title" id="biking-on-a-hill">Biking on a hill</h4>

                        <p class="problem">
                            One of the most common problems in some Danish cities is the big numbers of steep hills.
                            Your
                            legs hurt, you are tiring easy and sometimes you even give up and start pushing your bike.
                            Well,
                            here are some things that can prevent this.
                        </p>

                        <p class="solution"><strong>First of all</strong>, when you buy/rent your bike, take it with at
                            least 7 gears or
                            take an electric
                            one. Having a lot of gears lets you cycle easily on the hill, and you are not getting tired
                            that
                            easy. For the electric bike (it is more expensive but it's the best option) you feel like
                            you
                            are not biking.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution"><strong>Secondly</strong>, keep the same pace during your cycling. Try not
                            to
                            lose speed while
                            on a hill. You can
                            easily do this by simply accelerating before the hill and then using the strength of inertia
                            to
                            keep your tempo.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution">
                            <strong>Finally</strong>, don't stop! Yes, if you have a traffic light you should stop, but
                            otherwise try not to
                            fully stop, because this makes you exhausted quickly. When you stop, you must put a lot of
                            effort when you start moving again thus you are getting tired more easily.

                        <p class="problem">
                            Physical effort heats up your body and then... well, you sweat. You cannot change your body,
                            but you can apply some small tips to lower down the sweating and to prevent the need of
                            changing your clothes every time you bike.
                        </p>

                        <p class="solution"><strong>First</strong>, when you buy/rent your bike, take it with at
                            don't put so many clothes. You will heat up really fast when you start biking, so you don't
                            need to put a lot of clothes on. This way, by the time you start sweating, you will probably
                            have arrived at your destination.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution"><strong>Secondly</strong>, don't turn the pedals when you don't need to.
                            Going on a downhill, seeing a red light, those are times when you don't need to turn the
                            pedals. You won't lose much time don't worry about that. You are already saving time by
                            using a bike.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution">
                            <strong>Finally</strong>, get a jacket or hoodie with breathing material. They are sold in
                            every market, and they can protect you from sweating while keeping you warm during the harsh
                            winter months in Denmark.

                        <p class="problem">
                            Raining is pretty common in Denmark, so you must be prepared. There are a lot of ways, but
                            these are the most effective ones.
                        </p>

                        <p class="solution"><strong>Buy a mudguard for your bike.</strong> Get rid of all the
                            wetness and dirt on your feet and buy a mudguard for your bike. They are cheap things, and
                            you can attach them easily by yourself, so your feet are dry and clean.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution"><strong>Get yourself a rainproof cloth covers.</strong> Full body
                            raincoat or just pants and jacket that are waterproof – this solves the problem of being wet
                            in the rain. Your helmet will keep your hood up and because the clothes are thin and easily
                            bendable, you can always put them in your backpack.
